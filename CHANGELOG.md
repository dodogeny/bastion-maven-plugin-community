and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0] - 2025-08-29

### Added
- **🚀 Smart NVD Database Caching**: Revolutionary performance improvement system
  - Intelligent remote change detection via HTTP HEAD requests to NVD servers
  - Configurable cache validity periods (default 6 hours)
  - 5-10x faster scan times when database hasn't changed (8-13min → 2-3min)
  - Different caching strategies for users with/without NVD API keys
  - Automatic cache metadata management with robust fallback mechanisms
  - Custom cache directory configuration support
  - Smart caching can be enabled/disabled per scan
- **🔧 Enhanced Scanner Configuration**: Extended configuration options
  - `smartCachingEnabled`: Toggle smart caching feature
  - `cacheValidityHours`: Customize cache check frequency
  - `cacheDirectory`: Specify custom cache storage location
  - Backward compatible with existing configurations

### Improved
- **⚡ Performance Optimization**: Massive scan time improvements
  - First scan downloads and caches NVD database (~500MB)
  - Subsequent scans check remote database changes before downloading
  - With NVD API key: More frequent and accurate cache validation
  - Without API key: Conservative 24-hour cache policy for reliability
- **🔍 Enhanced Logging**: Better visibility into caching decisions
  - Clear cache status messages with emojis for easy identification
  - Detailed logging of cache hit/miss decisions
  - Performance impact metrics and timing information
- **📁 Default Cache Location**: Sensible defaults for cache storage
  - Linux/Mac: `~/.bastion/nvd-cache/`
  - Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.bastion\nvd-cache\`
  - Automatic cache directory creation and management

### Technical
- **🏗️ New Classes**: Added `NvdCacheManager` for intelligent caching
